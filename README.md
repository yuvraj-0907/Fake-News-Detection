# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a **machine learning-based solution** to detect whether a given news article is **real** or **fake**. Built using Python and popular ML libraries, the model analyzes textual news data and classifies it accurately based on learned patterns.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Classifies news as **real** or **fake**
- Preprocessing using NLP techniques (stopword removal, vectorization, etc.)
- Multiple ML algorithms tested (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Built in **Jupyter Notebook** for easy reproducibility

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing real and fake news articles, typically sourced from:
- **Fake News**: Misleading articles flagged from various fake news sources
- **Real News**: Verified content from reliable sources like Reuters, AP, etc.

> *(Note: Dataset can be found in `news.csv` or similar files â€” add link if hosted.)*

## ðŸ§  ML Techniques Used

- **Text Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering
- **Feature Extraction**: Bag of Words (CountVectorizer) / TF-IDF Vectorizer
- **Classification Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Passive Aggressive Classifier
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes

---

## ðŸ§ª Results

- Achieved **~92% accuracy** using Logistic Regression
- Confusion matrix and precision/recall metrics used to evaluate performance
- Model generalizes well to unseen data
